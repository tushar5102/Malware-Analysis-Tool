# Malware-Analysis-Tool

The code imports two modules malfind and malscan from the volatility.plugins.malware package. These modules provide functionalities to detect malware using memory forensics.

The code defines a process name to scan for fileless malware, which in this case is explorer.exe. The memory dump file name is specified as memory_dump.raw and the Volatility configuration file name is specified as profile.conf. These files must be present in the working directory.

The code initializes the MalfindCommand() plugin, which is used to scan for fileless malware using the calculate() method. The method takes the memory dump file, the Volatility configuration file, and the profile name as arguments, and returns an iterator over all tasks in the memory dump. The code iterates over this iterator and checks if the process name of each task matches the specified process name. If a match is found, the code prints the command line, loaded DLLs, and virtual address descriptor (VAD) tree of the task.

The code then initializes the MalscanCommand() plugin, which is used to scan for fileless malware using the calculate() method. The method takes the memory dump file, the Volatility configuration file, and the profile name as arguments, and returns a list of tuples, each containing a process ID and a dictionary of process information. The code iterates over this list and checks if the process name of each process information dictionary matches the specified process name. If a match is found, the code prints the command line, loaded DLLs, and memory sections of the process.

Overall, the code uses two different Volatility plugins to detect fileless malware in a memory dump file. The MalfindCommand() plugin is used to scan for malicious code injected into legitimate processes, while the MalscanCommand() plugin is used to scan for malicious processes that may be hiding their presence in the system. The code prints information about the potential malware found, which can be further analyzed by cybersecurity experts
